"Apple One Year Limited Warranty",
NULL,
"The Apple One-Year Limited Warranty is a voluntary manufacturer’s warranty. It provides rights separate to rights provided by consumer law, including but not limited to those relating to non-conforming goods.  As such, the Apple One-Year Limited Warranty benefits are in addition to, and not instead of, rights provided by consumer law and it does not exclude, limit or suspend a buyer’s rights arising from consumer law.  Consumers have the right to choose whether to claim service under the Apple One-Year Limited Warranty or under their consumer law rights. Important: The Apple One-Year Limited Warranty terms and conditions shall not apply to consumer law claims. For further information about consumer law, please visit the Apple website (www.apple.com/legal/warranty/statutoryrights.html) or contact your local consumer organisation.

Please note: All claims made under the Apple One-Year Limited Warranty will be governed by the terms set out in this warranty document.

Your Apple-branded or Beats-branded hardware product (“Product”) is warranted against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of ONE (1) YEAR from the date of original retail purchase (“Warranty Period”) when used in accordance with Apple`s user manuals (refer to www.apple.com/support/country). Under this warranty, you will be able to direct your claims to Apple even in situations where you purchased the Apple Product from a third party. If a defect arises during the Warranty Period, Apple, at its option will (1) repair the Product at no charge using new parts or parts that are equivalent to new in performance and reliability, (2) exchange the Product with a product with equivalent functionality formed from new and/or previously used parts that are equivalent to new in performance and reliability or with your consent, a product that is at least functionally equivalent to the product it replaces, or (3) refund the original purchase price. This warranty excludes normal depletion of consumable parts such as batteries unless failure has occurred due to a defect in materials or workmanship and, damage resulting from abuse, accident, modifications, unauthorized repairs or other causes that are not defects in materials and workmanship.

Apple does not warrant, represent or undertake that it will be able to repair or replace any Product under this warranty without risk to and / or loss of information and / or data stored on the Product.  In no event shall Apple be liable for (a) loss or damage, which as of the product’s purchase cannot be regarded as being caused by Apple’s breach of these warranty terms; or (b) losses caused by the user’s fault, loss of data or loss of profits or benefits.  

Any limitations of liability in this warranty document shall not apply to (i) death or personal injury pursuant to any mandatory law on product liability; (ii) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; (iii) intentional misconduct or gross negligence; (iv) or a culpable breach of major contractual obligations.  A damages claim based on a breach of major contractual obligations or gross negligence will be limited to foreseeable damage typical for the sale contract concerned.    

To obtain warranty service, contact Apple using the information described at www.apple.com/support/country. Proof of purchase may be required to verify eligibility. For product originally purchased in the U.S.A, Apple is Apple Inc. 1 Apple Park Way, Cupertino, CA 95014. For product originally purchased in Europe (other than Turkey), Africa and the Middle East, Apple is Apple Distribution International, Hollyhill Industrial Estate, Hollyhill, Cork, Republic of Ireland. For all other countries, Apple is described at www.apple.com/legal/warranty. Apple or its successors in title is the warrantor. For customers in the EU please review your statutory rights at  www.apple.com/legal/warranty/statutoryrights.html .

IMPORTANT RESTRICTION FOR SERVICE.

Apple may restrict warranty service for keyboard products to the country where Apple or its Authorized Distributors originally sold the device. Apple may restrict warranty service for keyboard products purchased in the EEA or Switzerland to the EEA and Switzerland.

Apple will provide warranty service through one or more of the following options:

(i) Carry-in service. You may return your Product to an Apple Retail or Apple Authorized Service Provider (“AASP”) location offering carry-in service. 

(ii) Mail-in service. If Apple determines that your Product is eligible for mail-in service, Apple will send you prepaid waybills and applicable packaging material, so that you may ship your Product to an Apple Repair Service (“ARS”) or AASP location. Apple will pay for shipping to and from your location if instructions regarding the method of packaging and shipping the Product are followed.

(iii) Do-it-yourself (DIY) parts service. DIY parts service allows you to service your own Product. If DIY parts service is available in the circumstances, the following process will apply. 

(a) Service where Apple requires return of the replaced Product or part. Apple may require a credit card authorization as security for the retail price of the replacement Product or part and applicable shipping costs. If you are unable to provide credit card authorization, DIY parts service may not be available to you and Apple will offer alternative arrangements for service. Apple will ship a replacement Product or part to you with installation instructions, if applicable, and any requirements for the return of the replaced Product or part. If you follow the instructions, Apple will cancel the credit card authorization, so you will not be charged for the Product or part and shipping to and from your location. If you fail to return the replaced Product or part as instructed or return a replaced Product or part that is ineligible for service, Apple will charge your credit card for the authorized amount.

(b) Service where Apple does not require return of the replaced Product or part. Apple will ship you free of charge a replacement Product or part accompanied by instructions on installation, if applicable, and any requirements for the disposal of the replaced Product or part. 

(c) Apple is not responsible for any labor costs you incur relating to DIY parts service. Should you require further assistance, contact Apple at the telephone number listed below.

Service options, parts availability and response times may vary according to country. If you require service in a country where Apple does not maintain an Apple Retail Store or Apple Authorized Service Provider (“AASP”), (a list of current service locations is provided at support.apple.com/kb/HT1434), service options may be limited. If a given service option is not available for the Apple Product in such country, Apple or its agents shall notify you about any additional shipping and handling charges which may apply before rendering service. Where international service is available, Apple may repair or replace Products and parts with comparable Product and parts that comply with local standards. 

If any term is held to be illegal or unenforceable, it shall be severed from this warranty and the legality or enforceability of the remaining terms shall not be affected. 

This warranty is governed by and construed under the laws of the country in which the product purchase took place. 

For Australian consumers: The rights described in this warranty are in addition to the statutory rights to which you may be entitled under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 and other applicable Australian consumer protection laws and regulations.

Repair of the goods may result in loss of data. Goods presented for repair may be replaced by refurbished goods of the same type rather than being repaired. Refurbished parts may be used to repair the goods.
